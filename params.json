{"name":"Rubyit","body":"A command line utility for parsing and evaluating any file with Embedded Ruby (erb). Example scenarios include using the flexibility of ruby to build a web site but which is static and does not require a restful interface. It can be created using ruby then built to a static site. Lowering maintenance and production costs, as nginx can be used to serve static files.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could have a .rbashrc with switches for different Operating Systems this then builds to custom .bashrc files. \r\n\r\nTemplating for any text based document.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n    gem install ruby_it\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHelp:\r\n\r\n    $ ruby_it --help\r\n\r\nBasic (all variables contained in the template):\r\n\r\n    $ ruby_it  --outpath ./ --file ./hellos.rtxt\r\n\r\nIntermediate (command line variables):\r\n\r\n    $ ruby_it --parameter @hellos=10 --outpath ./ --file ./hellos.rtxt\r\n\r\nAdvanced (Specify a centralised config file used by multiple templates):\r\n\r\n    $ ruby_it --config hello.conf --outpath ./ --file ./hellos.rtxt\r\n\r\nhello.conf\r\n\r\n    @hellos = 15\r\n\r\nhellos.rtxt, file with erb\r\n\r\n    <% @hellos.times do -%>\r\n    <%= 'Hello' %>\r\n    <% end -%>\r\n    \r\nAs part of a Ruby script\r\n\r\n    require 'ruby_it'\r\n    \r\n    thing_var = 3\r\n    rubyit = RubyIt::Document.new(\"../templates/hellos.rtxt\")\r\n    rubyit.add_parameter( \"@hellos = #{thing_var}\" )\r\n    rubyit.write\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n[More Examples](https://github.com/morganp/RubyIt/tree/master/examples)\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nFile Names\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe input files mist have a '.r' in the file extension when building this will be replaced with '.'. \r\n\r\n    *.rhtml    -> *.html\r\n     .rbashrc  -> .bashrc\r\n    *.rtxt     -> *.txt\r\n\r\nSince version 0.3.0 The template can change the output filename, by:\r\n\r\n    <% param = 1 -%>\r\n    <% $parent.out_filename = \"new_filename_#{param}.log\" -%>\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2011, Morgan Prior\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n        * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n          notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n        * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n          notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n          documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n        * Neither the name of the organization nor the\r\n          names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n          derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\n    ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\n    DISCLAIMED.
